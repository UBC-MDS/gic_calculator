## Summary

### Project Summary

This project involves developing a Python package designed to assist users in understanding and analyzing the financial returns from Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs). This [`link`](https://www.td.com/ca/en/personal-banking/personal-investing/products/gic/what-is-a-gic) explains what a GIC is in more detail. The package focuses on calculating the interest returns over different investment periods, comparing these returns, and providing a visual representation of the differences. This utility will be particularly useful for investors and financial advisors who need to make informed decisions regarding GIC investments.

### Functions Included in the Package

`interest_calc(principal, term_length, gic_rate=None)`: Calculates the interest earned on a GIC after a specified number of years.

`calculate_gic_difference(term_length_n1, term_length_n2, principal, interest_rate1=None, interest_rate2=None)`: Calculates the difference in total returns (interest + principal) of a GIC between two different investment periods.

`gic_plotting(principal, term_lengths, gic_rates=None)`: Generates a bar plot to visually represent the difference in returns as calculated by `interest_calc`.

### Fit into the Python Ecosystem

There are several Python packages focused on financial calculations and investment analysis, such as numpy-financial or pandas, which are used for a wide range of financial computations and data analysis. However, a specialized package focusing exclusively on GIC investment analysis, particularly one that compares returns over different investment periods and visualizes these comparisons appears to be unique. This package would thus fill a niche for those specifically interested in GIC investments.

By providing targeted functionality, the proposed package offers a more user-friendly and focused approach for individuals specifically dealing with GIC investments, setting it apart from more general financial analysis tools.

## Installation

#### For User

1.  (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment using conda
```
conda create --name <your-env-name> pip -y
conda activate <your-env-name>
```

2. Install the package using the command below
```
pip install gic_calculator
```

#### For Developer

Please refer to the `Developer Notes` session below

## Usage

`gic_calculator` can be used to calculate interest accrual on a GIC of varying term lengths or GIC rates, as follows: 

```
from gic_calculator.interest_calculator import interest_calc
interest_calc(5000, 1)
interest_calc(5000, 1, 5.5)
```

`gic_calculator` can be used to calculate the difference in total return (interest + principal) of a GIC between two different investment periods, as follows: 

```
from gic_calculator.gic_difference import calculate_gic_difference
calculate_gic_difference(1, 3, 5000)
calculate_gic_difference(1, 3, 5000, 5.5, 3.5)
```

`gic_calculator` can be used to create a bar plot to visually represent the difference in returns as calculated by `interest_calc`, as follows: 

```
from gic_calculator.gic_plotting import gic_plotting
gic_plotting(5000, [1, 3])
```

## Developer Notes

#### Installation

1.  Clone this GitHub repository down to your local computer.

2.  Create and activate a virtual environment using conda
```
conda create --name <your-env-name> python=3.9 poetry -y
conda activate <your-env-name>
```

3. Navigate to the root directory of the package and install the package
```
poetry install
```

#### Tests

We have included tests and test data for functions used in our analysis
in the `tests` folder. The test suite can be run at the root directory of the
project using the pytest command below:

```         
pytest tests/*
```
