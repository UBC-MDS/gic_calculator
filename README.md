## Summary

The Python package is designed as a comprehensive GIC (Guaranteed Investment Certificate) calculator, tailored for users in a Python environment. It comprises four key functions:

Interest Calculation: This function allows users to calculate the GIC interest return by inputting the principal amount, interest rate, and duration in years.
Total Return Calculation: This function combines the calculated interest with the principal to provide the total return on the investment.
Comparative Analysis: It enables users to understand the impact of choosing different durations for their GIC investment by calculating the difference in returns.
Visualization Tool: The package includes a bar plot feature, which visually represents the differences in returns for various durations, enhancing user understanding and decision-making.
The overarching goal of this package is to provide an easy-to-use, efficient tool for financial analysis and decision-making regarding GIC investments.
